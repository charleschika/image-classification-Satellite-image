# image classification on Satellite image dataset

This project is an implementation of image classification using different classification models, including traditional machine learning and deep learning.

Models
The following models were built:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (RF)
Decision Tree (DT)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)

Dataset
Satellite image Classification Dataset-RSI-CB256, This dataset has 4 different classes mixed from Sensors and google map snapshot

Results
The result shows that deep learning models perform better than machine learning
